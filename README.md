Given a list of words, determine whether the words can be chained to form a circle. 
A word X can be placed in front of another word Y in a circle if the last character 
of X is same as the first character of Y.

For example,

Given an integer n, return the length of the longest 
consecutive run of 1s in its binary representation.
For example, given 156, you should return 3

explanation 
binary of 156 (bin(156)) is '0b10011100'
there are max consecutive 1s is 3 

sample input
